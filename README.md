- Status: Acquired  
- Study Period: 3 months  

- Description:  
  This was my first formal experience studying computer and network fundamentals.  
  I studied consistently for three months, dedicating approximately 5 hours per day.  
  Through this process, I learned the basics of networking concepts such as IP addressing,
  network devices, and cabling.

  One of the most memorable and interesting parts was learning how to create LAN cables
  and understanding how physical network connections work.  
  This experience helped me build a strong foundation and increased my interest
  in networking and cybersecurity.
