Through hands-on labs and guided exercises, I learned how systems, networks,
and basic security concepts work from an attacker's perspective.

- Learning method: Hands-on labs, guided walkthroughs, self-practice
- Platform: TryHackMe

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Introduction to Cyber Security
- Networking fundamentals (IP, TCP/UDP, DNS, HTTP)
- Linux basics and command-line usage
- How the web works (clients, servers, requests, responses)
- Basic security principles and common threats

## 🛠 Hands-on Skills Gained
- Using Linux terminal commands for navigation and file management
- Understanding IP addresses, ports, and network communication
- Identifying common services and how they interact
- Basic enumeration mindset (what to look for before attacking)
- Reading and understanding simple logs and system information

## 🔍 Security Mindset Developed
- Learned how attackers think during the reconnaissance phase
